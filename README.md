# "Build a drag and drop to-do list" for the "React Practice Calendar" challenge by reactpractice.dev 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

- Eighth and ninth days of the calendar, the project now being a drag and drop to-do list, *Kanban* style
- This was a REALLY good challenge, definitely the most fun and most difficult at the same time
- Once again, I copied the main branch of the provided repo to avoid looking at the solution!
- Just a main branch, and a simple design that fits the task in order to display something decent
- Making use of [DnD Kit](https://dndkit.com/?ref=reactpractice.dev) was a nice change of peace, having to read the documentation in order to implement a good solution

**NOTE:** I'm really happy with how it turned out, although there might be some stuff that needs refining; for example, the way the selected Task moves up when being dragged, and such
